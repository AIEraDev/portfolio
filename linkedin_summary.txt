I am an AI Platform Engineer and CEO of AIEraDev, building the infrastructure for the next era of intelligent web applications.
My work bridges the gap between advanced Machine Learning and robust Full Stack engineering, utilizing Python, TypeScript, and Next.js.
I specialize in "context-first" product design, creating systems like Phantom that leverage AI to solve complex, real-time challenges.
Passionate about reliability, I advocate for code that outperforms human error, a philosophy I share through my writing and community leadership.
I am actively driving AI education in Africa, empowering a new generation of developers to master AI-driven workflows and tools.
